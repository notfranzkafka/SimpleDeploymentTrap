# Multi-Signal Deployment Monitor Trap

A contract deployment anomaly detection system for the Drosera Network, featuring multi-vector threat analysis and custom response handling.

## Overview

This trap monitors contract deployment patterns through multi-signal analysis, including deployment frequency, rapid deployment sequences, identical contract detection, and gas usage anomalies.

## Key Features

- *Multi-Signal Detection*: Analyzes 4+ different attack vectors simultaneously
- *Custom Response Contract*: Dedicated response handler with threat classification
- *Threat Scoring System*: Weighted analysis for accurate threat assessment
- *Pattern Recognition*: Detects coordinated attacks and bot behavior
- *Professional Architecture*: Clean, extensible codebase following best practices

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. *Main Trap Contract* (src/Trap.sol)
   - Multi-signal data collection
   - Threat scoring algorithm
   - Pattern-based classification

2. *Response Contract* (src/ResponseContract.sol)
   - Custom event logging
   - Alert categorization
   - Statistical tracking

3. *Deployment Infrastructure*
   - Automated deployment scripts
   - Environment configuration
   - Testing framework

### Detection Signals

- *Deployment Frequency*: Monitors deployment count thresholds
- *Rapid Deployment*: Detects high-frequency deployment patterns
- *Identical Contracts*: Identifies contract duplication spam
- *Gas Anomalies*: Analyzes unusual gas usage patterns

## Implementation Notes

This implementation uses simulated deployment patterns for demonstration on Hoodi testnet. The architecture is designed for easy extension to real blockchain data analysis.

*Current Approach*: Simulation-based detection for testnet demonstration
*Future Enhancement*: Direct blockchain transaction analysis for production use

The simulation framework provides a foundation that can be upgraded to analyze actual deployment transactions by modifying the data collection layer while preserving all detection logic.
